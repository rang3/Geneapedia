I made a sample hello.py from the quickstart. This is from the 
quickstart guide on the flask website.

You should install virtual env and run it on here.
Be sure to not add your virtual env.

to run the applet,
$ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
$ flask run

to run the debug mode,
$ export FLASK_DEBUG=1
$ flask run
